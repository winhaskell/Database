Trigger Syntax

As indicated earlier, triggers are fired automatically either before or after an SQL command is run in the database. 
The basic syntax for creating triggers is as follows:

CREATE TRIGGER TRIGGER_NAME
TRIGGER_TIME TRIGGER_EVENT
ON TABLE_NAME FOR EACH ROW
[TRIGGER BODY];

TRIGGER_NAME: Each trigger must have a unique name and you should define it here.

TRIGGER_TIME: Either BEFORE or AFTER.

TRIGGER_EVENT: You need to specify the database event that will invoke the trigger: INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

TRIGGER BODY: This specifies the actual SQL command (or commands) that you want to be run by your trigger.
