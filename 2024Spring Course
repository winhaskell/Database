2024Spring Course

Description
This course relies on primary readings from the database community to introduce graduate students to the foundations 
of database systems, focusing on basics such as the relational algebra and data model, schema normalization, 
query optimization, and transactions.  

For more information about the readings and assignments, use the links at the top of the page.

Quizzes are typically short answer / multiple choice, and contain questions that will test your knowledge of the readings, 
as well as questions on specific technical topics. Sample quizzes from previous years will be posted before the first exam.

Lectures, quizzes, and homework assignments will be the same. 

In the class' lab assignments, you will be using Java to write a basic database management system called SimpleDB, 
which includes modules for data access, query processing, transaction management, and more. To do these assignments, 
you will be building on a Java codebase with at least 1.6k lines of code by implementing classes, methods, and interfaces, 
and then testing your system by further writing unit tests. Since some (prospective) students have asked us about the 
level of comfort in Java required to succeed in this class, we are including this Java tutorial to help you get familiar 
with the language features you'll need to work on the lab assignments. The tutorial is geared towards Python programmers. 
We recommend taking a look at this tutorial and seeing the code in the first lab in order to determine if this class is right for you.
