10 SQL Query Optimization Tips

SQL Query optimization is a process of writing thoughtful SQL queries to improve database performance. During development, 
the amount of data accessed and tested is less. Hence, developers get a quick response to the queries they write.
But the problem starts when the project goes live and enormous data starts flooding the database. Such instances slow 
down SQL queries response drastically and create performance issues.

When working with large-scale data, even the most minor change can have a dramatic impact on performance.

SQL performance tuning can be an incredibly difficult task. Even a minor change can have a dramatic impact on performance. 
Here are the 10 most effective ways to optimize your SQL queries. 

Indexing: Ensure proper indexing for quick access to the database.
Select query: Specify the columns in SELECT query instead of SELECT* to avoid extra fetching load on the database.
Running queries: Loops in query structure slows the sequence. Thus, avoid them.
Matching records: Use EXITS() for matching if the record exists.
Subqueries: Avoid correlated sub queries as it searches row by row, impacting the speed of SQL query processing.
Wildcards: Use wildcards (e.g. %xx%) wisely as they search the entire database for matching results.
Operators: Avoid using function at RHS of the operator.
Fetching data: Always fetch limited data.
Loading: Use a temporary table to handle bulk data.
Selecting Rows: Use the clause WHERE instead of HAVING for primary filters.
