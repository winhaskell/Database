DATA SYSTEMS AND FOUNDATIONS

Berkeley has been a leader in data systems research through 50 years of evolution.

As data has become increasingly central to computing and society, our group's charter and collaborations have expanded. 

Our research covers a wide range of topics in data-centric computing. 
This includes projections on database systems, distributed systems, 
human computing and interaction, programming languages, security and privacy, 
AI and machine learning systems, and the theory of computation.

We actively support Berkeley's Principles of Community, recognizing the intrinsic relationship 
between diversity and excellence in all our endeavors.
