Advanced Database Systems
https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2020/

This course is a comprehensive study of the internals of modern database management systems. 
It will cover the core concepts and fundamentals of the components that are used in both 
high-performance transaction processing systems (OLTP) and large-scale analytical systems (OLAP). 
The class will stress both efficiency and correctness of the implementation of these ideas. 
All class projects will be in the context of a real in-memory, multi-core database system. 
The course is appropriate for graduate students in software systems and for advanced undergraduates 
with dirty systems programming skills.
