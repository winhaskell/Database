MongoDB 6.0 will come with a wealth of exciting new features for customers, including new capabilities 
for managing time series data. Notable improvements include support for secondary indexes on time series measurements, 
which makes it easier for users to index data that varies over time. 
Weâ€™ve also made read performance improvements for sort operations.
