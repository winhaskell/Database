Microsoft Research Lab â€“ Redmond

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/database/


The charter of the Database Group at Microsoft Research Redmond is to increase the usefulness 
of database system technology to users by creating, extending, and applying database technology. 
To that end, we consult with product groups at Microsoft and take part in exploratory research 
projects in several data management systems topics. See our current projects list for an overview 
of our active research areas.

The Database group has a long tradition of building systems as part of our research. Several of our
projects have contributed major technical innovations to Microsoft products. Examples include the 
Hekaton main-memory OLTP engine, SQL Server Apollo column storage, the Trill event processing system, 
and the FASTER key-value store.
